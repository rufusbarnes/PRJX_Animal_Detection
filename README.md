This is an animal detection project based off of **[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) Tutorial to Object Detection**.

The dataset used for training and validation is accessible on https://lila.science/datasets/snapshot-serengeti. The specific images ued are listed in the bbox_images_split.csv file in the snapshot-serengeti folder.

The conda environment used to run the program can be setup using the environment.yaml file.

Evaluation on the fully trained models can be performed by running eval.py from the directory the repository has been cloned to after launching the virtual environment with conda activate ENV_NAME_HERE.
